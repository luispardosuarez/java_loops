# Multiplication Table Exercise (java loops)

## Overview
This exercise is part of the bootcamp conducted by the F5 Foundation. It focuses on Java programming using Maven with the `archetype-quickstart-jdk8` archetype (2.8.1) and includes the Hamcrest library for testing.

## Exercise Description
Write a Java program that, given an integer `n`, prints its multiplication table from 1 to 10. Each multiplication `n * i` (where `1 <= i <= 10`) should be displayed on a new line in the format: `n x i = result`.

### Example
Given `n = 5`:

Output:
```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

## Technology Used
- **Java**: Programming language used to implement the solution.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool and project management tool.
- **archetype-quickstart-jdk8**: Maven archetype for Java 8 projects.
- **Hamcrest**: Testing library for more expressive assertions.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `mvn test` to execute the tests.

Feel free to customize the program or tests according to your learning objectives. Happy coding! ðŸš€
